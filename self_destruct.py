This code defines a `self_destruct` function that securely removes sensitive information and traces of activity. It includes three sub-functions: `erase_files`, `erase_logs`, and `erase_memory`. 

The `erase_files` function deletes the files generated by the AI assistant, including the files specified in the list `files`. It uses the `os.remove` function to delete each file if it exists.

The `erase_logs` function deletes any log files generated by the AI assistant, including the files specified in the list `logs`. It also uses the `os.remove` function to delete each log file if it exists.

The `erase_memory` function is a placeholder for code that would erase any sensitive information stored in memory. This code can be customized based on the specific requirements of the AI assistant.

Finally, the `self_destruct` function is called when the `self_destruct.py` file is executed directly. This ensures that the self-destruct mechanism is triggered when the AI assistant completes its tasks.
