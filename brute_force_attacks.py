    for username in usernames:
        for password in passwords:
            payload = {'username': username, 'password': password}

This code provides the functionality to perform brute force attacks on post data, headers, and authentication data. It includes functions `brute_force_post_data`, `brute_force_headers`, and `brute_force_authentication` that can be called with the appropriate parameters to perform the attacks. The code uses the `requests` library to send HTTP requests and iterate over the dictionaries to generate different combinations of data. The responses can be processed as needed.
